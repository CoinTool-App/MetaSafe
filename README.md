# CoinTool - MetaSafe

CoinTool - MetaSafe is a WEB 3.0 browser plugin against malicious approve and transfers, providing users with asset security! In the recent security incidents, we found that many users are threatened by malicious websites, phishing websites and web page hangings, causing significant loss of blockchain assets, including not limited to Token, NFT, etc. After our research, we developed this plug-in, which can intercept all calls to MetaMask behavior and analyze them for tips, providing global users with WEB3.0 Asset security protection!

## What is a threat site?
In the blockchain world, it is like a deep dark forest. Threat sites will try to get your assets by various means, including but not limited to disguising as well-known defi protocol sites, NFT sites, poisoning in well-known sites, etc. to induce or hijack users to send or authorize their assets to malicious addresses!

## Plugin principle?
Cointool - MetaSafe will intercept all approve and send Transaction, etc., will give the user a hint what operation is being performed, what address to send or authorize, etc., and through the blacklist and whitelist mechanism, etc. accurately tell the user the security status (such as uniswap protocol in the whitelist, will give whitelist tips, if one day (disappeared whitelist, then you have to check carefully, it is likely to be hacked poison!) to allow users to make accurate security judgments!
